# ALX Listing App

This project is a scaffold for building an Airbnb clone using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. It is designed to demonstrate best practices in code structure, reusability, and styling.

## Folder Structure

- `components/`: Reusable UI components like Card and Button
- `interfaces/`: TypeScript interfaces for props and data types
- `constants/`: Centralized constants such as config or text
- `public/assets/`: Images and SVGs for the app

## How to Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
